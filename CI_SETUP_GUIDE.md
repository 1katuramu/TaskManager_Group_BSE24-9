# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide - Week 2

## Overview
This document outlines the complete CI/CD pipeline setup for the Task Manager application using GitHub Actions.

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration
- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push and Pull Requests to `main` and `develop` branches
- **Jobs**: Frontend, Backend, Integration Tests, and Code Quality checks

### ✅ 2. Automated Build Process
- **Frontend Build**: React application builds with production optimizations
- **Backend Build**: Node.js server preparation and dependency installation
- **Build Scripts**: Located in `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`
- **Artifact Storage**: Build outputs saved for deployment

### ✅ 3. Testing Framework Integration
- **Frontend Tests**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Backend Tests**: Jest with Supertest for API testing
- **Coverage Reports**: 70% minimum coverage threshold
- **Test Files**:
  - `client/src/components/__tests__/TaskItem.test.js`
  - `client/src/components/__tests__/TaskForm.test.js`
  - `server/__tests__/server.test.js`

### ✅ 4. Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint**: Code linting with custom rules
- **Configuration**: `.eslintrc.js` and `.eslintignore`
- **Rules**: Enforce consistent code style and catch common errors
- **Coverage**: Integration with test coverage reporting

## Pipeline Workflow

### Job 1: Frontend Build and Test
```yaml
- Install dependencies
- Run ESLint
- Run tests with coverage
- Build production bundle
- Upload build artifacts
- Upload coverage reports
```

### Job 2: Backend Build and Test
```yaml
- Install dependencies
- Run tests with coverage
- Upload coverage reports
```

### Job 3: Integration Tests
```yaml
- Install all dependencies
- Start backend server
- Test API endpoints
- Test frontend-backend integration
```

### Job 4: Code Quality Check
```yaml
- Run ESLint on entire project
- Check code formatting
- Validate code standards
```

## How to Test the Pipeline

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline setup"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. You should see the workflow running
4. Click on the workflow to see detailed logs

### 3. Verify Build Artifacts
- Frontend build files will be available as artifacts
- Coverage reports will be uploaded
- All tests should pass

## Local Testing Commands

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### Run Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### Run Complete CI Pipeline Locally
```bash
npm run ci
```

## Coverage Requirements
- **Branches**: 70% minimum
- **Functions**: 70% minimum  
- **Lines**: 70% minimum
- **Statements**: 70% minimum

## Next Steps (Future Weeks)
1. **CD Pipeline**: Add deployment to staging/production
2. **Database Integration**: Add database testing
3. **Security Scanning**: Add security vulnerability checks
4. **Performance Testing**: Add load testing
5. **Monitoring**: Add application monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Tests Failing**: Check test files and update accordingly
2. **ESLint Errors**: Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix
3. **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility
4. **Coverage Issues**: Add more test cases to reach threshold

### Getting Help
- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Run commands locally to reproduce issues
- Update dependencies if needed: `npm update`

## Success Criteria ✅
- [x] CI pipeline triggers on push/PR
- [x] Automated build process working
- [x] Tests running with coverage reports
- [x] Code quality checks integrated
- [x] Build artifacts generated
- [x] Pipeline completes successfully

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for Week 3!
