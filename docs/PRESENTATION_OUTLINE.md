### Slide 4: CI/CD Architecture Overview
```
Development → Staging → Production
     ↓           ↓         ↓
   Tests     Integration  Approval
   Build     Tests       Gates
   Quality   Deployment  Monitoring
```

### Slide 5: Pipeline Components
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing and validation
- **Staging Deployment**: Automated staging environment
- **Production Deployment**: Approval-gated production releases
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring
- **Rollback**: Automated and manual rollback mechanisms

### Slide 6: Technology Stack
