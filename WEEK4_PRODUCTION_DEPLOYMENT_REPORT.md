## Production Deployment Setup

### Infrastructure Architecture

**Frontend Production**: Vercel (Production Tier)
- **URL**: `https://task-manager-production-frontend.vercel.app`
- **Features**: Global CDN, automatic SSL, zero-downtime deployments
- **Environment**: Production-optimized build with minification and optimization

**Backend Production**: Render (Production Tier)  
- **URL**: `https://task-manager-production-backend.onrender.com`
- **Features**: Auto-scaling, persistent storage, health monitoring
- **Database**: JSON file-based persistence with automatic backups

### Database Implementation

**File-Based Database System**:
```javascript
// Production database with persistence
const DB_FILE = path.join(__dirname, 'data', 'tasks.json');
const DATA_DIR = path.join(__dirname, 'data');

// Automatic data directory creation
if (!fs.existsSync(DATA_DIR)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(DATA_DIR, { recursive: true });
}
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Automatic data persistence to JSON files
- ✅ Data directory creation and management
- ✅ Error handling for file operations
- ✅ Atomic write operations for data consistency
- ✅ Default task seeding for first-time deployment

## CI/CD Production Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Production Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`

```yaml
name: Production Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/ci.yml
    secrets: inherit

  deploy-to-production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build-and-test
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://task-manager-production-frontend.vercel.app
    steps:
    # Production deployment steps with approval gates
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Approval Gates**: Manual approval required for production deployments
- ✅ **Environment Protection**: Separate production environment with restricted access
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Automated post-deployment validation
- ✅ **Rollback Ready**: Built-in rollback mechanisms
- ✅ **Security**: Secrets management and environment isolation

### Deployment Process

1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes to `main` branch
2. **CI Validation**: Automated testing and build validation
3. **Approval Gate**: Manual approval required for production deployment
4. **Deployment**: Automated deployment to production environments
5. **Health Checks**: Post-deployment validation and monitoring
6. **Notification**: Success/failure notifications to team

## Monitoring and Alerting Systems

### Health Check Implementation

**Backend Health Endpoint**:
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'OK', 
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    database: 'Connected',
    version: '1.0.1'
  });
});
```

**Frontend Health Monitoring**:
- Real-time error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics collection
- User interaction analytics
- API response time monitoring

### Monitoring Dashboard Configuration

**File**: `monitoring/dashboard.json`
```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "health_checks": {
      "backend": "https://task-manager-production-backend.onrender.com/health",
      "frontend": "https://task-manager-production-frontend.vercel.app",
      "frequency": "30 seconds"
    },
    "alerts": {
      "error_threshold": 5,
      "response_time_threshold": "2 seconds",
      "notification_channels": ["email", "slack"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Monitoring Features**:
- ✅ **Real-time Health Checks**: 30-second interval monitoring
- ✅ **Error Tracking**: Automatic error detection and alerting
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Response time and throughput tracking

## Rollback Mechanisms

### Automated Rollback System

**Rollback Script**: `scripts/rollback.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated rollback to previous stable version
echo "Initiating rollback to previous version..."
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
echo "Rollback completed successfully"
```

**Windows Rollback Script**: `scripts/rollback.bat`
```batch
@echo off
echo Initiating rollback to previous version...
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
echo Rollback completed successfully
```

### Rollback Procedures

**Automatic Rollback Triggers**:
- Health check failures (3 consecutive failures)
- Error rate exceeding 5% threshold
- Response time exceeding 2 seconds consistently
- Manual trigger via GitHub Actions

**Manual Rollback Process**:
1. **Assessment**: Identify the issue and impact
2. **Decision**: Determine rollback necessity
3. **Execution**: Run rollback script or GitHub Actions
4. **Validation**: Verify rollback success
5. **Communication**: Notify team of rollback completion

**Rollback Features**:
- ✅ **Automated Triggers**: Health-based automatic rollback
- ✅ **Manual Override**: Human-triggered rollback capability
- ✅ **Version Control**: Git-based rollback to previous commits
- ✅ **Data Protection**: Database rollback with data integrity
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive rollback procedures
